(See log/ChangeLog for more detailed changes derived directly from source control.)

== 0.8.3 / 2008-07-21 Charlie Savage

* Missed several files in last release

== 0.8.2 / 2008-07-21 Charlie Savage

* To use LibXML you can either require 'xml' or require 'libxml'. 
  The differences is that require 'xml' mixes the LibXML module into
  the global namespace, thereby allowing you to write code such
  as document = XML::Document.new.  Note that this is different 
  from 0.8.0 and 0.8.1 and may require updating your code.

* Support RelaxNG validation (thanks to Morus Walter)

* Support passing IO objects to XmlReaders (thanks to Tom Hughes)

* Fix segmentation fault caused by adding an attribute to a CDATA node

* Moved node checking functions from C to Ruby

* Improved Windows support - libxml-ruby should now work out of the box.

* Improved Windows support - turned on libxml's zlib and iconv support.


== 0.8.1 / 2008-07-09 Charlie Savage

* Reimplmented Node#each_attr for backwards compatability

* Moved node type test to Ruby.


== 0.8.0 / 2008-07-09 Charlie Savage

* Fixed bug in returning attributes from XPath results

* Fixed DOM traversal methods

* Changed Node#children to return an array of nodes

* Fixed bug in returning attributes from XPath results

* Refactored XPath support, providing more user hooks in the XPath::Context class

* Added Node#properties for backwards compatibility

* Updated setup.rb

* Added more tests

* Updated rdocs and README file

* Moved libxml into LibXML namespace


== 0.7.0 / 2008-07-09 Charlie Savage

* Added new attributes class to provide a more natural way of working with attributes

* Fixed XML::Attr to better support namespaces

* Added documentation on how to use namespaces with XPath

* Removed allocation of extraneous structures used to wrap nodes, namespaces and attributes

* Cleaned up tests and added new test suite

* Updated rdocs and README file

* Cleaned out most of the bug list


== 0.6.0 / 2008-07-01 Charlie Savage

* Fixed memory allocation errors in Windows.  On Windows, it is essential that the same library that allocates memory must free it. Thus ALLOC calls must be matched to ruby_xfree calls, which they were not.  In addition, in one case Ruby was allocating memory to be freed by libxml.  On Windows, that's a segmentation fault.  On Linux it might fly, but still seems like a bad idea.

* Fixed segmentation fault in xml reader expand (same xml tree freed twice)

* Applied a number of patches from Tom Bagby, including fixes for xpath segmentation faults and fixes for various memory leaks

* Cleaned up a number of compiler warnings

* Renamed libxml_so.so to libxml_ruby.so (same for xslt).  That wasn't actually my original intention, but um, it kind of sort of happened.  It should not be noticeable from an end-user perspective.

* Added rake files for building with MingW

* Added rake files for packing gems.  Note that I did this outside the existing rake tasks because I didn't see how they were actually building the gems.

* Cleaned up the tests and added a few more based on bug reports from the Tracker and mailing list.

* Cleaned out the patch queue and went through about 1/2 the bug list

  name, when you were setting the value of an already existing
  attribute.

  of xml documents from nodes taken from other xml documents
  without making ruby SIGSEGV (see tests/copy_bug.rb).

=== 2004-02-26 "Martin Povolny" <martin@solnet.cz>

* ruby_xml_dtd.c, ruby_xml_dtd.h, ruby_xml_schema.c, ruby_xml_schema.h:
  more work on validation, now you can actually validate
  document using dtd or xml schema, also solved warning and
  error propagation (see tests/{dtd|schema}-test.rb).

=== 2003-12-30 "Martin Povolny" <martin@solnet.cz>

* ruby_xml_dtd.c, ruby_xml_dtd.h, ruby_xml_schema.c, ruby_xml_schema.h:

* ruby_xml_document.c: corrected argument handling in ruby_xml_document_find
* ruby_xml_node.c: corrected argument handling in ruby_xml_node_find
