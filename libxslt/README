== INSTALLATION

Installation is simple.  Follow the following steps:

=== Rubygems

  gem install libxslt-ruby
	
=== Tarball/zip	

  $ rake test
  $ rake install

If extconf yacks up an error, follow the instructions it provides.
You will need to chdir to ext/xml and run 'ruby extconf.rb' to provide
options, after which you can either use Rake for everything or 
do with make (make && make install).

Once installed, look at the test scripts (tests/*.rb), and run 
'rake doc' to generate API documentation.

== DOCUMENTATION

RDoc comments are included - run 'rake doc' to generate documentation.
You can find the latest documentation at:

* http://libxml.rubyforge.org/doc/xslt

== USAGE EXAMPLE

*Note*: To use libxslt, you have to require both 'xml/libxml' and 'xml/libxslt'.

  $ cd tests
  $ ruby fuzface.rb

== If you checked out from CVS

If you checked out the source from CVS, you must install a copy of
the current (or matching) libxml-ruby headers in:

  ext/xml/libxml-ruby
	
prior to running the above. This can be done via rake, and will
happen automatically if ../libxml/ext/xml is found, or the
LIBXMLH=/path/to/headers commandline option is supplied.
