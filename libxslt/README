Make sure you have libxml2, ruby-libxml, and libxslt installed!

$ rake
$ cd tests && ruby fuzface.rb
# rake install

See tests/fuzface.rb or utils/document_self.rb for details.

To use libxslt, you have to require 'xml/libxslt'

If you checked out the source from CVS, you must install a copy of
the current (or matching) libxml-ruby headers in:

	ext/xml/libxml-ruby
	
prior to running the above. This can be done via rake, and will
happen automatically if ../libxml/ext/xml is found, or the
LIBXMLH=/path/to/headers commandline option is supplied.
