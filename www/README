This is the auto-generated Rote documentation source.

To render it using Rote's command-line wrapper (ignoring the included
Rakefile), type:

  rote doc

from the top-level directory (this one).

To render using the included Rakefile (the result is the same in either
case) type instead:

  rake doc
  
If you prefer, you can omit the 'doc' task, since it is configured
as the default.  

In either case, you should see some output as the pages are rendered 
and resources copied, and get output in a (created) 'html' directory.
Once you have rendered the site, running the command again will appear
to do nothing, because only changed resources are re-rendered. To 
start over:

  (rote|rake) clobber

Alternatively, modify the page or resource files, and rerun the first
command to transform only the modified resource.

WHAT NEXT?

	+ See what else you can do by typing:
	
			  (rote|rake) --tasks
			  
			  rote --usage		( with the command-line wrapper )
			  
  + Modify the included page template and layout to suit your needs. 

  + Edit the included Rakefile to add or change tasks, or delete it
    if you're sticking with the command-line wrapper.

  + Add more pages and layouts.

  + Start Rote in monitor mode, and have your changes rendered as
    you work:

        (rote|rake) monitor
